# 5 Coding Tips

- No variable abbriviations
It is not a competition to write code with the least number of characters. Understandibility counts!
- No magic numbers
Use descriptive names!
- Do not add useless comments to your code, most time the code must be understandable without comments. Comments are only useful if they discribe the code on a higher abstraction level.
- Functions should do only one thing!
- Use debuggers!
